# Automated-Testing-for-E-Commerce-Website

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to automate the functional testing of a web-based eCommerce platform. The automation script was built using Selenium WebDriver with Java and simulates a complete user journey from login through product search, add-to-cart, and checkout, ultimately verifying the order confirmation message. The script mimics real-world user interactions, helping ensure critical features work as expected and offering a fast, reliable way to perform regression testing.
